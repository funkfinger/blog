Here's the front-end development stack that I'm leaning towards for a new build that I'm contemplating (at this specific momement):

- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) - JS lib
- [babeljs.io](http://babeljs.io) - ES6 now
- [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/jsx/) - possibly for templating - prefered by React
- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) - bundler
- [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) - testing framework

Today, it's looking like Facebook is winning my attention on open source projects - not sure why this is. I'm still interested in Google's [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), but am feeling like jumping into that ecosystem might feel a little locked in- React may feel like the same thing, but I guess I'll see...
