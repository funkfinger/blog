OSH Park pretty much rules. This was my first toe into making a PCB to be produced. I used [Eagle](https://cadsoft.io/) to design it and [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) to get it made. A week or so later, I got these boards in the mail:

I added a combination of female and male headers to the Dragon and a ziff socket in the programing area. The completed board and Dragon look like this:

See Fig 6-5 in the [AVR Dragon User Guide](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42723-AVR-Dragon_UserGuide.pdf) for how this is hooked up. Feel free to order this board fron [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/dpRLKfmm)
