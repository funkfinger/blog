Well, I've been working on this thing, but have not making the kind of progress I would like. I blame this on a few things, but mainly we've been social (which isn't really a bad thing)...

Anyway, here's where things stand:

<h2>User</h2>
sign-up, email activation, login, password reset, and logout seem to be in order
<h2>Oauth</h2>
is working on a high level but needs to be cleaned up and better integrated into the rest of the User experience.
<h2>Site functionality</h2>
in the initial stages, need to (and <strong>will</strong>) work on that tonight
