Here's a list of big-time OpenID providers that are discoverable. This means you don't need an exact URL, which is cool...

<ul>
	<li><b>Google: </b>https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id</li>
	<li><b>Yahoo: </b>http://yahoo.com</li>
	<li><b>MySpace: </b>http://myspace.com</li>
	<li><b>myOpenID: </b>hhttp://myopenid.com</li>
</ul>

Additionally, if you have Google Apps, you can craft an OpenID URL like this: `https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/site-xrds?hd=example.com` --- Hmm, but it doesn't seem to work... will update if I figure it out.
