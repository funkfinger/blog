Yep. switching up the blog tech stack one more time. This time using [`Gatsby`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) which is based on [`React`](https://reactjs.org) and getting deployed using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) - the code and content for the blog can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/funkfinger/blog)

BTW: I know you probably thing it's not looking great - "Is this an improvement?!?!", but I'm sort of looking at a pre-2k web asthetic for now.... will likely revisit it sometime (probably not) soon.

Here's what it used to look like for reference...
